asterisk_logger is a *nix daemon startup script.  See the User Manual for how to use / install.

asteriskLogger_* are old versions of asteriskLogger.  They are included for reference:
 - v5.2 supported AMI v1.0
 - v6.1 the author changed the script to only work with v1.1

As a result, yaai still only works with AMI v1.1  doing a diff between the two should provide insight into the changes
that were made.

en_us.lang.php is a file if you want to update the dropdown for Calls so users can select minute increments.
